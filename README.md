There is something wrong with my system, as I am unable to copy addresses. I am experiencing problems with my computer because I can't copy the addresses that I deployed.
The addresses are manually entered into readme.md
In my clipboard, no matter what I copy, when I paste the address it just shows this
0xCf05a09F3D05f46cE68e16C102666938666d3845
It is my hope that you understand what I am trying to say
